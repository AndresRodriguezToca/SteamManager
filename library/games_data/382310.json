All the data generated from the interaction of plants, animals, climate, and players can be searched and analyzed using in-game graphs and heat-maps. Use the collected information as scientific evidence support to proposed laws.

Draft a proposal to limit clear-cutting in a protected forest, incentivize green energy solutions over fossil fuels by providing tax subsidies and penalties. Participate in elections for world leadership, allowing you to set tax rates and allocate community money.  Use a programmable law system to make dynamic and flexible rules for the community, passing them by vote.   Construct a wide variety of governments; from tightly-regulated dictator-states, to tax-and-spend subsidy programs, or even lawless communities relying on trust.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/shared.akamai.steamstatic.com\/store_item_assets\/steam\/apps\/382310\/extras\/Gov2.gif?t=1702431957\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/shared.akamai.steamstatic.com\/store_item_assets\/steam\/apps\/382310\/extras\/Learn_and_Specialize.png?t=1702431957\" \/><br>Your skills increase based on your food and shelter.

Create stores to buy and sell goods you need asynchronously with other players. Setup contracts within the game\u2019s quest-like labor market, soliciting other players to perform specialized work for you in exchange for payment. Build complex crafting machines and charge a fee for players to use them. A thriving economy in Eco can be both a powerful tool for progress, or a dangerous threat to the environment.<br><br>To grease the wheels of commerce, you can create your own currencies, backed by fiat or by resources.  Manage the value of your currency relative to others by setting exchange rates at asynchronous currency exchanges. Sell items at stores and collect credit from other players.  Eco is designed for rich asynchronous play, allowing many players of many disciplines to contribute to one another\u2019s goals at separate or simultaneous times. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/shared.akamai.steamstatic.com\/store_item_assets\/steam\/apps\/382310\/extras\/Mint.png?t=1702431957\" \/><br><img src=\"https:\/\/shared.akamai.steamstatic.com\/store_item_assets\/steam\/apps\/382310\/extras\/A_World_With_Consequences.png?t=1702431957\" \/><br>All of the world\u2019s resources originate from its environment, which is affected by your actions.  While a meteor looms over head \u2014  set to strike the planet in thirty days \u2014 a more subtle threat grows from player-interaction with the environment.  Without careful attention, ecological destruction can destroy civilization before the meteor even strikes.
