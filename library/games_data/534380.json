However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor \u2014 the last city standing on Earth.<br><br>You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You\u2019ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor\u2019s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night.

During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems\u2026 fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets.

Sometimes it\u2019s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor.

Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor\u2019s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT<\/h2>In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let\u2019s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE<\/h2>Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends.
